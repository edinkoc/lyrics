(HONESTLY TOO BORED AT THE CLASS, IT WAS EITHER SLEEPING OR DOING THIS)

Lyrics - Because Why Not Print Lyrics When You're Bored?

Welcome to Lyrics! 😒

This is just a random repository I made when I was really bored. The concept? Simple: print out the lyrics of a song with a perfect delay that matches the beat. It's like karaoke, but without all the embarrassing singing. You play the music, I print the lyrics, and we pretend it's a professional concert.

Features (Or, You Know... What It Does) 👍🏻

Prints out lyrics with a perfect delay — matching the timing of the song! All you need to do is run the script and start the music in the background. It’s like magic, but less magical and more "I just made a Python script." There’s a surprise at the end. Yeah, you’ll have to wait for it. I promise it’s worth it… probably.

The Surprise (Don’t Skip Ahead) Trust me, there’s a surprise waiting for you at the end of the lyrics. But don’t cheat and skip to the last line — where’s the fun in that? (LOL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT)

A Quick Disclaimer (So It Doesn’t Break Your Heart) 😬

This is a random project. It’s not perfect. It’s not professional. It’s just me being bored. Timing may not be flawless (like that one friend who always messes up karaoke), but hey, it’s a good time. Don’t expect a Grammy for using it. This isn’t a serious repo… unless you’re REALLY into random fun projects.

Contributing (If You’re Feeling Generous) 🤨

Feel free to fork this chaos and improve it. If you’ve got ideas, send a pull request! I promise I won’t judge you for your contributions... but maybe a little bit. JUST KIDDING BUT DEF ADD WILDFLOWER BY LANA AND ALL THE STARS BY KENDRICK AND SZA CUZ I'M IN THAT ERA OF MY LIFE

License (If You’re Into That Kind of Thing) 😱

This project is licensed under the MIT License (LOL). Go wild. Just don’t break anything.
